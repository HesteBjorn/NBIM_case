    Classification: Dividend Calculation Methodology
    Materiality: 6,200 CHF gross amount difference, 4,030 CHF net amount difference, 2,000 share
                quantity discrepancy
    Priority: High
    Root Cause: Systems use different quantities for dividend calculations - NBIM uses quantity field
                while Custody uses holding_quantity field, resulting in material financial amount
                discrepancies in account 823456791 where NBIM calculated on 10000 shares versus
                Custody's 12000 dividend-eligible shares
    Consequence: Systematic calculation methodology failure creating tangible financial discrepancies
                across dividend payments. Risk of recurring errors in future dividend events due
                to fundamental system logic differences. Potential compliance issues with
                incorrect dividend entitlements and tax calculations affecting multiple accounts.
    Evidence: custodian field mismatch across all accounts: NBIM shows 'UBS_SWITZERLAND' while Custody
            shows 'CUST/UBSCH'; account 823456789 has NO financial mismatches: all amounts match
            perfectly (gross_amount=62000.0, net_amount=40300.0, settlement_net_amount=40300.0,
            withholding_tax=21700.0); quantity mismatch in account 823456790: NBIM   
            quantity=15000.0, Custody quantity=30000.0, but holding_quantity in Custody=15000.0
            matches NBIM quantity; financial calculation consistency in account 823456790:
            despite quantity mismatch, all financial amounts are identical (gross_amount=46500.0,
            net_amount=30225.0, withholding_tax=16275.0); financial amount mismatches in account
            823456791: gross_amount (31000.0 vs 37200.0), net_amount (20150.0 vs 24180.0),
            settlement_net_amount (20150.0 vs 24180.0), withholding_tax (10850.0 vs 13020.0);
            quantity vs holding_quantity discrepancy in account 823456791: both systems show
            quantity=10000.0, but NBIM has no holding_quantity while Custody shows   
            holding_quantity=12000.0; consistent pattern across all Custody records: 
            holding_quantity appears to be the dividend-eligible amount (20000.0, 15000.0,
            12000.0) used for financial calculations

    Classification: Tax Treatment Discrepancy
    Materiality: 180,500 KRW withholding tax difference, 450,050 KRW net amount difference, 2% tax rate
                discrepancy
    Priority: Medium
    Root Cause: Fundamental disagreement on tax treatment between NBIM and Custody systems. NBIM
                applies 22% withholding rate plus 3% local tax (total 25%), while Custody applies
                20% withholding rate with no local tax. The 2% rate difference creates a 180,500
                KRW withholding tax discrepancy and 450,050 KRW net amount difference. This appears
                related to securities lending treatment where 2,000 shares are on loan, potentially
                receiving different tax rates, but the systems are accounting for this differently.
    Consequence: Financial impact of approximately $342 USD in net amount difference creates settlement
                discrepancies requiring manual intervention. Tax treatment disagreement indicates
                dividend events, creating ongoing operational burden and reporting inaccuracies.
    Evidence: pay_date field mismatch: NBIM shows '2025-05-20' while Custody shows '2025-05-25';
            net_amount field mismatch: NBIM shows 6,769,950.0 while Custody shows 7,220,000.0
            (difference of 450,050 KRW); settlement_net_amount field mismatch: NBIM shows 5,181.5
            while Custody shows 5,524.27 (difference of 342.77 USD); withholding_tax field
            mismatch: NBIM shows 1,985,500.0 while Custody shows 1,805,000.0 (difference of
            180,500 KRW); withholding_rate field mismatch: NBIM shows 22.0% while Custody shows
            20.0%; NBIM has local_tax of 269,550.0 KRW (exactly 3% of gross amount:
            269,550/9,025,000) while Custody shows local_tax as nan; NBIM shows total_tax_rate as
            25.0% (22% withholding + 3% local tax) while Custody shows nan; Custody shows
            holding_quantity (23,000.0) and loan_quantity (2,000.0) while NBIM shows both as nan
